Craigslist Updater
===================================

This is a repository for the Craigslist Updater app.

This app utilizes the [Craigslist Scraper](https://github.com/mikekaminsky/craigslist_scraper) app to:

1. Pull all results from Craigslist from a given location with a given query,
2. Determine which posts are 'new',
3. Save the results in a database, and
4. Deliver emails to recipients containing the new postings.
